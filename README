Welcome to my repository, this is the start of my journey in beloved python quest, but this repo will not only include python related project but other language depends on my interest, but still python will be the main actor here, little back story, I have used java for 7 years professionally as Java EE devs, in between I also work professionally on Ruby On Rails, phonegap, react native, riotjs, node js for multiple company as Your standard salary man and many other side project for profit or hobby, so why python ?.

My first python encounter is during my first job after graduate, and like others, when you graduating and walk to real world things will not go as smooth as butter, and python become my victim of hate on first sight, I mean, really mean, I loath python, this is because of my immature experience as software engineer and back at the day the project I'm working on is OpenERP customization, which could be said really complex system with its own business flow which I know nothing of, really in this stage python is my nemesis.

So why I create this repo and said python as my beloved, well its not satire for sure, I really love python now, mainly because during this 7 years of working as software engineer my experience taught me many thing, after trying so many different language, paradigm, framework, etc, python by far is the most loveable with its incredible intuitive pseudocode like style, big, I mean huge package of ready to use code, the possibility is limitless, and 2 days ago I read article which said python will replace java and C as most popular programming language, then this is My chance to have more interesting working experience using python as My main language professionally.

Hope this repository could help anybody in whatever way You think fit, as this will help Me to begin my professional work in python one more time.
